During my time on this team, I also got familiar with deployment tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Github Actions and AWS. I was able to deliver new features, resolve old technical debt, and build out prototypes for new tools and services.",

I wanted to move into a career where I could have more impact in what I was doing and more agency over my own growth. After validating my interest in coding, I decided this was the direction I wanted to go in. During this time, I attended a bootcamp to provide some structure and acceleration to the learning process.",
