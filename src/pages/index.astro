                    I'm working as a full-stack engineer at VIA, where I started
                    out on a client-facing team building and maintaining a
                    frontend app in Angular, as well as APIs and Microservices
                    in Python. During my time on this team, I also got familiar
                    with deployment tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Github
                    Actions and AWS. I was able to deliver new features, resolve
                    old technical debt, and build out prototypes for new tools
                    and services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After continued growth, I was able to make a move to VIA's
                    Platform team, where I am able to make a larger impact by
                    building services and tools that all client-facing teams are
                    able to use when building their applications. Since joining
                    this team, my growth has skyrocketed and I've been able to
                    increase the scope of my work as well as help shape the
                    direction of our products and technology choices.

                    While I searched for full time work, I took on a couple
                    freelance opportunities, the first of which was working on
                    UI components (React) for a very early stage companyâ€™s
                    website. During this time, I learned about web accessibility
                    and UI design systems.

                  <p>
                    After this contract ended, I worked on standing up an MVP
                    mobile app (React Native) marketed toward trucking
                    companies. I worked on features like authentication,
                    navigation and routing, push notifications with deep
                    linking, and integrating with device APIs like device
                    location and camera/photos.

                Prior to taking the plunge into a career in tech, I worked for a
                number of years in the sales and recruitment space. I wasnâ€™t
                happy in any of those roles and I decided I needed to make a
                change. I wanted a career where I could make an impact and feel
                proud of what I was doing.
