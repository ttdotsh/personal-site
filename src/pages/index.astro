                  I'm working as a full-stack engineer at VIA, where I started
                  out on a client-facing team building and maintaining a
                  frontend app in Angular, as well as APIs and Microservices in
                  Python. During my time on this team, I also got familiar with
                  deployment tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Github Actions and
                  AWS. I was able to deliver new features, resolve old technical
                  debt, and build out prototypes for new tools and services.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After continued growth, I was able to make a move to VIA's
                  Platform team, where I am able to make a larger impact by
                  building services and tools that all client-facing teams are
                  able to use when building their applications.

                I worked briefly as a freelance developer and took on projects
                using React helping a budding startup put together a component
                library for internal use, and React Native and Expo building out
                an MVP mobile app for a trucking company to help automate
                dispatching and check-in workflows.

                I had been unhappy with my career path in recruitment for a
                while, and eventually I decided it was time to make a move. I
                wanted to move into a career where I could have more impact in
                what I was doing and more agency over my own growth. After
                validating my interest in coding, I decided this was the
                direction I wanted to go in. During this time, I attended a
                bootcamp to provide some structure and acceleration to the
                learning process.
